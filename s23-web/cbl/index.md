# CBL, S'23

This semester, your CBL project will be with the Worcester Public schools as our community partner. You will work in groups to develop and deliver a lesson to 7th graders at Worcester East Middle School while they are studying ancient Athens in their social studies curriculum. The curriculum is connected to the state Frameworks standards, which for 7th grade social studies on ancient Greece includes the following that are related to our work with Lysias 1 “On the Murder of Eratosthenes”:


> **Ancient and Classical Greece** c. 1200–300 BCE [7.T4b] 
> Supporting Question: How does the democracy of Athens compare to the democracies of today? 
> 
> 3) Explain the democratic political concepts developed in ancient Greece. a. the “polis” or city-state b. civic participation and voting rights c. legislative bodies d. constitution writing e. rule of law 


*CBL project grade*: Your project will be evaluated in three phases. Each phase is worth two points: one for submission on time, and one for satisfactory completion. Successfully completing each phase allows you to continue to the next phase. The phases are:

1.	Project proposal
2.	Completed rehearsal of lesson
3.	Delivering the lesson at Worcester East Middle School

*CBL lab participation*: There will be *up to* 9 CBL lab meetings this semester. You will earn one point for each lab meeting you prepare for, attend, and participate in respectfully.






## 1) Project proposal

Your proposal will be a complete written lesson plan. In support of your development of this proposal, we will do the following in CBL lab meetings.

- February 1 & 2 lab meeting: prepare for that meeting by re-reading the entire speech in translation (as a reminder, here is a link to that: https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/reference/falkner/) and an  "Introduction to the Athenian Legal System" (https://www.stoa.org/demos/article_intro_legal_system@page=all&greekEncoding=UnicodeC.html) to get you started on your research.
- February 8 & 9 lab meeting: Colleen Kelly, the History & Social Science Liaison for the Worcester Public Schools and a Holy Cross alumna, will visit lab to tell you more about the context for the project: the curriculum, the Frameworks standards, and Worcester East Middle School.
- February 15 lab meeting: both lab sections will meet together on Wednesday evening, February 15. Mary Beth Cashman, the Director of the Teacher Education Program (TEP), and senior TEP students will visit to give a presentation on how to prepare a lesson plan for 7th graders. 

In the following two weeks (including the February 22/23 and March 1/2 lab meetings), your group will 

1. draft a proposed lesson plan;
2. share your draft with your assigned 7th-grade teacher at Worcester East Middle School;
3. meet with your assigned 7th-grade teacher at Worcester East Middle School for feedback on your draft;
4. revise your draft according to that feedback.

**Due Date**: Your project proposal, including your lesson plan and a report on your meeting with and feedback from the Worcester East teacher, is due to Professors Ebbott and/or Smith, by 3 pm on March 3.

## 2) Rehearsal of lesson

When your proposal is approved as “satisfactory,” you and your group will rehearse delivering it. The lab meetings on March 15/16 and March 22/23 and in time on your own will be devoted to rehearsal. You must give a complete rehearsal to Professor Smith or Professor Ebbott by March 23. That rehearsal must be deemed “satisfactory” or you will be given feedback and asked to rehearse again.

## 3) Delivery of lesson at Worcester East Middle School

You will deliver your lesson with your group members at Worcester East Middle School during the week of March 27–31.
