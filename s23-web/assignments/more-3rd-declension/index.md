## In-class assessment

For the seven verbs listed below, be able to fully identify any form you know in the context of a sentence. For finite forms, explain the use of the mood; if infinitive or participle, explain why. 

Example sentence:

> **εἶπε** Ἐρατοσθένη ταῦτα οὐ **δεῖξαι**.


- εἶπε: third singuilar aorist indicative active.  Indicative verb in main clause stating a fact.
- δεῖξαι: aorist infinitive active.  Infinitive in indirect statement after a verb of speaking or thinking.
