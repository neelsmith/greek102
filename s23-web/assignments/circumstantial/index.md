## Reviewing participle formation

Review the summary of participial forms in your text book [here](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/review/module3-review/grammar/).  Notice the following patterns:

- in the *active voice*, present and aorist participles follow a 3-1-3 pattern (third declension in masculine and neuter, first declension in feminine)
- in the *middle voice*, present and aorist participles follow a 2-1-2 pattern (second declension in masculine and neuter, first declension in feminine)
- the *present passive* is identical to the the present middle
- the *aorist passive* follows a 3-1-3 pattern


## Written homework

Using the list of verbs  below, fill in the cells of a table like this one with the *nominative and genitive singular* for each following participle:

| Tense and voice| Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| --- | --- | --- --- |
| Present active | | | |
| Present middle | | | |
| Present passive | | | |
| Aorist active | | | |
| Aorist middle | | | |
| Aorist passive | | | |

For example, for the verb κελεύω,  the first row would be

| Tense and voice| Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| --- | --- | --- --- |
| Present active | κελεύων, κελεύοντος  | κελεύουσα, κελευούσης | κελεῦον, κελεύοντος  |

Please complete this table for:

- γίγνομαι
- λέγω
- ποιέω


## Class preparation

Read in English sections 12-14 in Caroline Falkner's translation of Lysias 1.  These sections include a number of long, complex sentences.  If you were going to express these English ideas in Greek, which sections could you try to express with a participle?

## Reviewing principal parts

Review the principal parts of [these important verbs](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/review/module1-review/vocabulary/).

On Wednesday, we'll practice a short in-class assessment on the first half of the list (βάλλω through ἔχω), and will take an in-class assessment on Friday.
