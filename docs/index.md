### Overview

We begin to work with first and second person forms, and introduce the present indicative. We learn what a synopsis is, and practice using synopses as a way to review forms.

### Assessments

On Friday, we'll practice an in-class assessment on a synopsis of κελεύω, before taking an assessment on Monday.
