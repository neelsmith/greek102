### Overview

We continue to learn about indirect speech in Greek. We distinguish between indirect speech using the infinitive after verbs of speaking from indirect speech with the participle after verbs of perception.

### Assessments

- Friday: pratice assessment in class: synopsis of all three voices of the present, imperfect and aorist indicative in a given person and number, together with all three voices of the infinitive for each tense.
