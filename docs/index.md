## Notes and review

### Formation of the future system

Principals of formation are like the *future participle*:

- use the same endings as the present system
- use the second principal part for active and middle voices
- use the sixth prinicipal part extended with -ησ- for the passive voice

Third singular examples: the indicative mood.

| Tense | Active | Middle | Passive | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Present | ἄρχ-**ει** | ἄρχ-**εται** | ἄρχ-**εται** |
| Future | ἄρξ-**ει** | ἄρξ-**εται** | ἀρχθήσ-**εται** |
