## Week at a glance: Jan. 30 - Feb. 3

### MWF classes

We review the declension of substantives, and the types of verbal expression we encountered in Greek 101.

### CBL
For your first CBL meeting, please read this [introduction to the Athenian legal system](https://www.stoa.org/demos/article_intro_legal_system@page=all&greekEncoding=UnicodeC.html), and reread one or both translations of Lysias 1 in your textbook. (You can further resources on Athenian democracy on the ["Dēmos" web site](https://www.stoa.org/demos/).)

What can we learn about the Athenian legal system from reading Lysias 1?
