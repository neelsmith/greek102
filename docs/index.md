## Review from Greek 101

To begin the semester, we will review the following topics, and have in-class assessments covering them.

1. **declension of the article, nouns and adjectives**.  Assessment: correctly form the expression "the unjust judgment" ὁ ἄδικος γνώμη in any or all forms.  References to review in your textbook:
   - the forms of the article (section 13.2.2.3, p. 159)
   - the forms of first declension nouns like γνώμη (section 13.2.2.4 p. 169)
   - the forms of first and second declension adjectives ("2-1-2" adjectives) are summarized in section 13.2.2.7. *Note* that ἄδικος, ἄδικον has only *two* endings for each case and number: masculine and feminine forms are identical (e.g., in the nominative singular, masculine and feminine are both ἄδικος, neuter is ἄδικον). *Therefore you will only see second-declension endings on a two-ending adjective*.
2. **declension of participles**. Assessment: correctly form the attribute expressions "the one committing hubris" ὁ ὑβρίζων and "the one who committed hubris" ὁ ὑβρίσας  in any or all forms. References to review in your textbook:
   - the forms of the article (section 13.2.2.3, p. 159)
   - the forms of the present active participle (section 13.4.2.2 p. 172). Recall that the present active participle is a 3-1-3 adjective, using third-declension endings for masculine and neuter, and first-declension endings for the feminine forms. (As always, look at the genitive singular ending to figure out the declension.)
   - the forms of the aorist active participle, summarized here:


*The aorist active participle of κελεύω*:
