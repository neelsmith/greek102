## Final assignment


Time table:

- schedule an appointment to identify passage: April 24 (after 2:30) or April 25 (before 3:00)
- first draft of written assignment due May 3
- final revisions due May 9


### Written assignment

For the passage agreed on with your instructor, write a short comparison of the two translations by Falkner and Lamb. You should:

- identify any sections where they actually conflict
- identify other differences where, without directly contradicting each other, they differ in emphasis or how they present the text

You should consult the Greek text of Lysias when making your comparison. When you identify differences between the translations, you should comment on which one is, in your view, either a more accurate expression of the Greek, or why you prefer one over the other. Cite specific features of the Greek when making these evaluations.
