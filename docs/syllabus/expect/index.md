# What to expect 

The fall semester introduced the most frequent features of the Greek language. It is essential to master this material, both because you will encounter it constantly in reading Greek, and because it will give you a framework that will make it easier to learn further features of the language this semester. In the first weeks of the spring semester, we will review and expand on material introduced in the fall; throughouyt the semester, we will periodically pause to review important content. 

Some concepts may sink in immediately, and others may take more practice.  Review and practice are as important as your initial introduction to a topic, so every graded assignment offers you the opportunity to repeat it as often as you need in order to complete it satisfactorily.

Most of our class time together will be devoted to actively applying and using ideas from your class preparation..

## Tips

These practices will help you absorb material most effectively:

- Schedule regular times both for newly assigned homework and review of previously covered material.
- Spread your study across several days each week. Multiple, shorter sessions are better preparation than an equal amount of time in a single marathon.
- Practice your Greek aloud. Vocalizing Greek and listening to yourself will help you progress more rapidly than reading silently.
- When you are studying, focus only on Greek. Turn off your cell phone and any other electronic communications. Turn off any music: you should see, hear and speak only Greek.
