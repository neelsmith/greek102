# Community-based learning

Community-based learning (CBL) is an essential part of our course.  We are privileged to be be able to study Greek together in our MWF class meetings.  In your CBL work, you will share some of that experience with others. Community-based learning helps us to understand our language study in a broader context. The active engagement it requires also will improve your development of the language skills required for your study of Greek.

In the spring semester of 2023, our community partner will be the Worcester Public School system.  The Massachussetts state frameworks for middle-school social studies includes topics about ancient Greek democracy.  Your CBL work will include a weekly CBL section meeting on campus, where you will learn more about the Athenian legal system, and will develop a lesson plan that will culminate in leading a class for middle-school students at nearby Worcester East Middle School.
