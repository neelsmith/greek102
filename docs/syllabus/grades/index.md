# Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in these categories:

1. larger written assignments ("portfolio" assignments)
1. regular written assignments for class preparation 
1. in-class assessments of specific features of language or vocabulary
1. CBL work


All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements, the assignment is satisfactory.

Portfolio assignments, written homework assignments and in-class assessments may be repeated or revised as often as you like up until a deadline for revisions thtat will be included with each assignment.  Normally, the deadline will be 3:00 pm on Friday of the following week.

## Process for submission and revision of written assignments

**Submission**: On days that a written assignment is due, I will bring a manila folder to class. You submit your written assignment by leaving it in the folder. I will do my best to return the marked assignment to you at the following class.  

**Revision**: To revise a written assignment, bring the original marked submission to my office during my drop-in hours or at any other time we agree on prior to the deadline for revisions. You may also bring written corrections if you like. I will ask you to explain your corrections, whether you give them to me in writing or orally.

Because the material in this course is cumulative, you should keep an organized notebook of your final revisions.  To make your written useful as a later reference, please observe these rules in *all* written submissions:

1. **Include the question or instructions as well as your answer.**
2. **Please skip lines in all written assignments.**



## Portfolio assignments

Over the course of the semester, you will develop a portfolio of seven longer assignments. As we cover modules 4 and 5 of the course, you will complete the same triad of assignments you completed in Greek 101: a mastery assignment, a reading and translation assignment, and a composition in Greek. In module 6, you will develop a single larger assignment that compares two published translation and your own reading of a passage of Lysias.

Throughout the semester, we will set aside class meeting time to workshop drafts of these longer assignments.

Each portfolio assignment earns one point for a complete submission on time, and a second point if it fulfills all the requirements for a satisfactory grade by the deadline for revisions. 

Portfolio assignments may be revised as often as you like up to the deadline for revisions for each module. 

The total points you can earn in this category is 14.



##  Written homework assignments


The course schedule will include *up to 8*  brief written assignments as part of your routine class preparation.  Each assignment can earn up to two points: one point for a completed *submission* by the specified deadline, and a second point for a grade of *satisfactory*. 

The specifications for these assignments are straightforward: a submission is satisfactory if all responses are correct; an error means that the assignment is not satisfactory. If you submit an assignment on time (earning one point), but have an error, you may resubmit a corrected version as often as you like up until the deadline for final revisions for that module. When a revised submission is satisfactory a second point will be recorded for that assignment.


The total number of points you can earn in this category is 12.




## In-class assessments

In addition to written preparation, we will have *up to ten* regular in-class assessments. 

In-class assessments will always be announced ahead of time, and we will always do at least one practice version together in at least one class before we have a graded in-class assessment.

In-class assessments earn up to two points, one point for completing the assessment, and a second point if you correctly answer 90% of the questions.  You may retake these assessments as often as you like up until the deadline for retakes.  You may not retake an assessment that you have missed for an unexcused class absence. To retake an assessment, bring the original marked assessment to my drop-in hours or any other time we agree on.

If we have fewer than 10 assessments, you will receive two points credit for any assessments we omit. For example, if we have 9 assessments, you will start with two points credit in this category, and earn up to 18 points for the other nine. Note that the calculation of final course grades is not affected by the number of assessments we end up having.

The total number of points you can earn in this category is 20.


## CBL lab

Throughout the year, you will participate in a weekly CBL lab.

You will receive two grades for CBL lab work.

- participation: seven CBL sections are scheduled to meet at Holy Cross.  You earn one point for each section you attend, for a possible total of 7.
- small group project: satisfactory completion of projects in 3 steps. Each step can earn 2 points, for a total possible of 6 points.

The total number of points you can earn in CBL is 14 for participation and 6 for the project.


## Determination of final course grade

Your course grade will be recorded by reading the following table.  Each column records points in one of the five grade categories. In each row, the numbers represent the *minimum* number of points required in that category for the grade in that row. For example, If you only earn 5 points for CBL participation, the highest course grade you can earn is a C. If you earn all CBL points and score 11 points for homeworks and 18 points for in-class assessments, but only 11 points for portfolio work, your grade would be a B.
