# Organization of the course



All course material will be available on the course web site at [https://neelsmith.github.io/greek102/](https://neelsmith.github.io/greek102/).  



## Textbook

We will continue to use the open-source *Hellênikê* textbook:

- current on-line version [https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/)
-  current PDF of the textbook [https://github.com/hellenike/textbook/raw/main/pdf/hellenike.pdf](https://github.com/hellenike/textbook/raw/main/pdf/hellenike.pdf).


After introducing features of the ancient Greek language, each module of the textbook includes reading that connects the topics you are studying to contemporary experience, and concludes with a reading selection from an authentic ancient text.  This semester, our reading selections continue to draw on Lysias 1, *On the Murder of Eratosthenes*.
