# CBL, S'23

Beginning in the second week of the semester, our focus will be on developing a lesson plan for middle schoolers, aligned with the Massachussetts state frameworks.

During the last full week of classes before Easter break (March 27-31), you will teach one or more classes at Worcester East Middle School.

## Schedule

- week 2: Please read this [introduction to the Athenian legal system](https://www.stoa.org/demos/article_intro_legal_system@page=all&greekEncoding=UnicodeC.html), and reread one or both translations of Lysias 1. What can we learn about the Athenian legal system from reading Lysias 1?
