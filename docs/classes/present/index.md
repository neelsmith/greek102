# The present indicative

In your online textbook, read [this introduction to the present indicative](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/expanding/present-indicative/).


## Synopses

A *synopsis* (from σύνοψις, a "general view," or literally, "seeing things together") is a summary of verb forms in many tenses and voices for a given person and number. This can be a helpful way to review forms.  For example, here is a synopsis of κελεύω for the present, imperfect and aorist indicative in the first person singular.


| Tense | Active  | Middle  | Passive  |
| --- |  --- | --- | --- | 
| Present indicative| κελεύω | κελεύομαι | κελεύομαι |
| Imperfect  indicative| ἐκέλευον |  ἐκελευόμην | ἐκελευόμην  |
| Aorist indicative| ἐκέλευσα | ἐκελευσάμην | ἐκελεύσθην | 


## Class preparation

Please write out the following synopses of the present, imperfect and aorist tenses. Since these are indicative forms, you should be able to translate each form as a complete sentence.

1. second person plural of κελεύω
2. third person singular of ποιέω
3. first person plural of δείκνυμι
