# Indirect speech with the participle


Read this introduction to [indirect statement using the participle](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/module4/participles/).


For each of the example sentences, be prepared to:

- fully identify the form of the main verb (TV-M-PN)
- fully identify the participle of the indirect expression (TV-GCN)
- fully identify the noun or pronoun that serves as the subject of the participle (and that the participle therefore agrees with) (GCN)
- explain the accompanying English translation
