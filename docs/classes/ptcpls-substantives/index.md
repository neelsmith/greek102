# Participles as adjectives

As verb forms, participles have both tense and voice.  Review 

As adjectives, they have *gender*, *case* and *number*, and like any any adjective they agree in gender, case and number with the noun they modify.

Review the forms of the [aorist and present participles](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/review/module3-review/grammar/), and compare them to the forms you have just learned of the [perfect participles](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/expanding/perfectparticiple/).  Fill out the following reference sheet for yourself, and bring it to class. In the column for declension pattern, enter either **2-1-2** (i.e., second declension endings for masculine and neuter forms, first declension endings for feminine forms), or **3-1-3** (third declension endings for masculine and neuter forms, first declension endings for feminine forms).  In the columns for "masculine/neuter stem" and for "feminine stem", enter the appropriate stem with no ending.


| Participle | Principle part | Declension pattern | Masculine/neuter stem | Feminine stem |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Present active |  | | | |
| Present middle or passive | |  |  | |
| Aorist active | |  | | |
| Aorist middle | |  | | |
| Aorist passive | |  | | |
| Perfect active |  | | | |
| Perfect middle or passive | | | |  |



## Written homework: attributive participle expressions

Be sure you are confident about all forms of the article. (You can review them in your textbook [here](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/review/module2-review/grammar/).)


Using the appropriate verb from your [module 1 vocabulary list](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/review/module1-review/vocabulary/), compose an attributive participle expression for the following English clauses or phrases. You do not need to include any nouns: the correct participial expression is enough.

1. In the genitive singular, "the man who threw or struck."
2. In the genitive singular, "the woman who threw or struck."
3. In the dative plural, "the men who were struck."
4. In the dative plural, "the women who were struck."
5. In the accusative plural, "the things that are being thrown."
6. In the nominative plural, "the contents." (Literally, "the things that were contained or held." This is the normal way in both ancient and modern Greek to refer to the contents of a book, for example.)
7. In the nominative plural, "the people who have come (and pay attention to the implications of that right now!)".
8. In the dative singular, "the man acting in his own interest."
9. In the dative singular, "the woman acting in her own interest."
10. In the genitive plural, "what happened." (Literally, "the things that came about or happened." This is the phrase that the first great Greek historian, Herodotus, famously uses to refer to past events in the proem to his work.)
