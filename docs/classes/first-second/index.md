# The first and second persons

Up until now, we have been reading texts entirely in the third person ("he", "she", "they", "it"). A significant part of Lysias 1 is narrated in the first person ("I", "we") as Euphiletos tells the jury about his personal experience, and at several points he directly speaks to the jury members in the second person ("you"). In addition, the narrative section includes quoted conversations where people speak to each other in the first and second person.

To form the first and second person forms, you follow exactly the same process as you do for third-person forms: you will use the same principal parts, and apply augment to the imperfect and aorist indicative exactly as you have done before, but you will use the appropriate ending for the first and second person-number combinations.

There are some common patterns to those endings that can help you recognize these new forms.


In your online textbook, read through [this introduction to the first and second persons](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/expanding/first-second-person/), and refer to it to complete the following comparisons.

## Compare first person forms

Compare the first person endings of the aorist middle with the endings of the imperfect middle. How are they alike?


## Compare second person forms


Compare the second person endings of the aorist middle with the endings of the imperfect middle. How are they alike?


## The aorist passive



The endings of the aorist passive look very much like the imperfect tense of εἰμί, "to be." Here is a complete conjugation of εἰμί : compare first and second person endings of the aorist passive forms .

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First | ἦ or ἦν | ἦμεν |
| Second | ἦσθα | ἦστε or ἦτε |
| Third | ἦν | ἦσαν |
