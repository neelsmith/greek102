# Review composition from module 4

Review the composition you submitted for [module 4](../mod4composition). To prepare for our review in class, make sure you have available:

- glosses from [module 4 mastery](../mod4mastery/) assignment
- glosses from [module 4 reading/analysis/translation](../mod4reading/) assignment

Remember that the final result should be a continuous paragraph of coordianted Greek, not a list of sentences.
