# Expressing purpose with the future participle

In your textbook, read this section about [the formation of the future tense](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/module5/future/).


Since a circumstantial participle in the future tense identifies a that the circumstance *will* happen (but hasn't yet), it often expresses *purpose*. 

 > ἡ γυνὴ ἀπῄει κάτω καθευδήσουσα.

 > My wife went downstairs to sleep.




In general, ὡς with a circumstantial participle indicates that the participle expresses the belief or basis on which the subject of the main verb is acting.   

> οὐκ ἐψιμυθιωσθη ὡς τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τεθνεῶτος.

> She did not wear makeup, since her brother had died.

ὡς with a a future participle clearly marks it as expressing the subject's viewpoint and therefore purpose.


Write an expression using ὡς with a future participle to express the highlighted phrases.
