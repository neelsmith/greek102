# The perfect participle

In the on-line version of your textbook, read this [introduction to the perfect participles](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/topics/expanding/perfectparticiple/). Regardless of their tense, all participles can be used in the same constructions (circumstantial, attributive, or supplementary).

The perfect tense has a particular meaning. How does the meaning of the perfect tense relate to the aorist and present tenses?

## Things to think about

You will find that even more than the present and aorist participles, the perfect participle appears overwhelmingly frequently in circumstantial constructions.  Why do think that might be?

## In class

We will have a brief practice assessment on forms of the aorist and present participles.  We will have a graded assessment on Monday.
