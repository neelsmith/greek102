# Portfolio assignment: module 4 reading


## Overview 

You will compose a paragraph with seven sentences, modelled loosely on the narrative of Lysias 1.14-1.15. In addition to following the specific instructions for each sentence, you should consider the construction of your paragraph as a whole. Each sentence should be connected to the previous sentence with a particle or conjunction.

> *Please skip lines*.


## Instructions

1. Your first sentence should say that near dawn, Euphiletos heard the door make a sound. (Use a plural form of θύρα, since Euphiletos' house had folding double doors!)
2. The second sentence should say that he thought that his wife had gone out. Use can use the adverb ἔξω "outside" to express the idea of something "outside the house." To convey "go out", use the compound verb ἐξέρχομαι (ἐξ + the familiar verb ἔρχομαι).
3. The next sentence should say that when he asked (her) about the matter, she said that the lamp next to the baby had gone out. Use a participle to express the subordinate circumstance "when he asked"; you can allow the pronoun "her" to be inferred in Greek.  Use an infinitive construction for the indirect statement.
4. The next sentence should *continue the wife's indirect statement* using infinitive construction to say that (she claimed) she did not want to waken him, but was willing to get the lamp lit from the neighbors herself. 
5. Next, you should say that after some time had passed, an elderly woman approached Euphiletos.  Use the compound verb προσέρχομαι (προς + the familiar verb ἔρχομαι), and use the *dative* case for its object (as often with compounds involving προσ). Use an appropriate pronoun to refer to Euphiletos.
6. The next sentence should say that she claimed that she had been sent secretly by her mistress. Use a subordinate clause for the indirect statement, and in your choice of mood leave room for scepticism about the woman's claim.  Refer to the elderly woman's "mistress" with the noun γυνή.
7. Finally, say that Euphiletos heard that Eratosthenes was committing adultery with his wife. 

## Glosses
