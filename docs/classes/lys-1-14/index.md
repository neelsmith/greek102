# Indirect speech in Lysias


Analyze the following selection from Lysias 1.14:

> ἔφασκε τὸν λύχνον ἀποσβεσθῆναι τὸν παρὰ τῷ παιδίῳ, εἶτα ἐκ τῶν γειτόνων ἐνάψασθαι. ἐσιώπων ἐγὼ καὶ ταῦτα οὕτως ἔχειν ἡγούμην. ἔδοξε δέ μοι, ὦ ἄνδρες, τὸ πρόσωπον ἐψιμυθιῶσθαι, τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τεθνεῶτος οὔπω τριάκονθ' ἡμέρας

Using the glosses below, and reading either the handout distributed in class or the syntactically formatted version of the passage [online here](https://neelsmith.github.io/greek102/lysias1/reader/1.14.html) (but analyzing only the content from ἔφασκε to τριάκονθ' ἡμέρας), identify all boxed verb forms. Explicitly named subjects are underlined; fully identify all subjects.


## Glosses

- σιωπάω (regular principal parts) : "keep silence"
- ἀπο + σβέννυμι, σβέσω, ἔσβεσα, ἔσβηκα, ἐσβέσθην : "extinguish, put out"
- ἐν + ἅπτω, ἅψω, ἧψα, -, ἧμμαι, ἥφθην : "touch; kindle, set on fire (by touching)"
- ψιμυθιόω (rare! ἐψιμυθιῶσθαι is probably a *perfect* passive infinitive): "paint with white lead; put on makeup (of white lead)"
- θνῄσκω, θανοῦμαι, ἔθανον, τέθνηκα, -, -, "die"; perfect tense, "be dead"
