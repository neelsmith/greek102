# The perfect system


### Formation of the perfect system

- use the fourth principal part for the active voice
- use the fifth principal part for the middle and passive voices. Like the present system, the perfect system uses identical endings for middle and passive

### The perfect participles

- active voice: a 3-1-3 adjective
- middle and passive voices: a 2-1-2 adjective (compare the endings of the present middle and passive participle!)
- note the accent persists on the ending
