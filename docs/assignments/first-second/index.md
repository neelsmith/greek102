# First and second person forms

Study the first and second person endings we introduced in class so that you can recognize those forms.  

Start by identifying the principal part: that will limit the range of tenses and voices you need to consider. Then find the ending: it will then guide you to a full identification including mood as well as person and number.

Apply this to Lysias 1, chapter 12.
