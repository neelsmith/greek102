## Verbal expressions

We'll review the following kinds of verbal expressions we saw in Greek 101:

- independent clauses with finite verbs, normally coordinated by a conjunction or particle
- subordinate clauses with the indicative mood, introduced by a subordinating conjunction
- circumstantial participles
- attributive participles

You saw a version of section 15 of Lysias 1 last semester. Look at the c(complicated!) first sentence only of [that section here](https://neelsmith.github.io/greek102/lysias1/reader/1.15.html). You will not recognize all the vocabulary, but try to figure out the type of each verbal expression.  (The second versoin with highlighting and indentation should help!)


## In-class assessment

In today's class, we will have a brief language assessment asking you to provide all forms for the phrase, τὸ κακὸν πρᾶγμα.
