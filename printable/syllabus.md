# Goals

Greek 102 is the continuation of Greek 101.  Our curriculum is inspired by the Latin 101-102 sequence developed by several members of our department at Holy Cross, led by [Professor Machado](https://dominicmachado.github.io), and shares a directly parallel set of overarching goals.  By the end of this course, you will:

  - identify ways that  language structures our understanding of the world we live in
  - articulate how the Greek language has shaped and continues to shape structures of power in the modern world
  - read and pronounce Greek with confidence and accuracy
  - analyze syntax and sentence structure in Greek and English
  - express complex ideas in written composition both in Greek and in English
  - read authentic, unaltered Greek texts with minimal glossing




# Community-based learning

Community-based learning (CBL) is an essential part of our course.  We are privileged to be be able to study Greek together in our MWF class meetings.  In your CBL work, you will share some of that experience with others. Community-based learning helps us to understand our language study in a broader context. The active engagement it requires also will improve your development of the language skills required for your study of Greek.

In the spring semester of 2023, our community partner will be the Worcester Public School system.  The Massachussetts state frameworks for middle-school social studies includes topics about ancient Greek democracy.  Your CBL work will include a weekly CBL section meeting on campus, where you will learn more about the Athenian legal system, and will develop a lesson plan that will culminate in leading a class for middle-school students at nearby Worcester East Middle School.




# Organization of the course

All course material will be available on the course web site at [https://neelsmith.github.io/greek102/](https://neelsmith.github.io/greek102/).

## Textbook

We will continue to use the open-source *Hellênikê* textbook:

  - current on-line version [https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/](https://hellenike.github.io/textbook/)
  - current PDF of the textbook [https://github.com/hellenike/textbook/raw/main/pdf/hellenike.pdf](https://github.com/hellenike/textbook/raw/main/pdf/hellenike.pdf).

After introducing features of the ancient Greek language, each module of the textbook includes reading that connects the topics you are studying to contemporary experience, and concludes with a reading selection from an authentic ancient text.  This semester, our reading selections continue to draw on Lysias 1, *On the Murder of Eratosthenes*.




# What to expect

The fall semester introduced the most frequent features of the Greek language. It is essential to master this material, both because you will encounter it constantly in reading Greek, and because it will give you a framework that will make it easier to learn further features of the language this semester. In the first weeks of the spring semester in particular, we will periodically pause to review briefly material introduced in the fall.

Some concepts may sink in immediately, and others may take more practice.  Review and practice are as important as your initial introduction to a topic, so every graded assignment offers you the opportunity to repeat it as often as you need in order to complete it satisfactorily.

Most of our class time together will be devoted to actively applying and using ideas from your class preparation. Since much of the value of this time results from your active engagement with course material, and cannot be replicated by passively watching someone else's involvement, I do not plan to record our class meetings.

## Tips

These practices will help you absorb material most effectively:

  - Schedule regular times both for newly assigned homework and review of previously covered material.
  - Spread your study across several days each week. Multiple, shorter sessions are better preparation than an equal amount of time in a single marathon.
  - Practice your Greek aloud. Vocalizing Greek and listening to yourself will help you progress more rapidly than reading silently.
  - When you are studying, focus only on Greek. Turn off your cell phone and any other electronic communications. Turn off any music: you should see, hear and speak only Greek.




# Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in these categories:

 1. portfolio assignments
 2. written assignments for class preparation
 3. in-class assessment of specific features of language or vocabulary
 4. CBL lab work
 5. CBL project

All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete all requirements, the assignment is satisfactory.

Portfolio assignments, written homework assignments and in-class assessments may be repeated or revised as often as you like up until a deadline for revisions thtat will be included with each assignment.  Normally, the deadline will be 3:00 pm on Friday of the following week.

## Portfolio assignments

Over the course of the semester, you will develop a portfolio of *up to 9* longer assignments. Three of these will demonstrate mastery of basic features of language by analyzing and explaining forms and constructions; three will be analyses and translations of passages in Greek; three  will be compositions in Greek.

Throughout the semester, we will set aside class meeting time to workshop drafts of these longer assignments.

Each portfolio assignment earns one point for a complete submission on time, and a second point if it fulfills all the requirements for a satisfactory grade by the deadline for revisions.

Portfolio assignments may be revised as often as you like up to the deadline for revisions for each module. s

The total points you can earn in this category is 18.

## Class preparation

The course schedule will include *up to 6*  brief written assignments as part of your routine class preparation.  Each assignment can earn up to two points: one point for a completed *submission* by the specified deadline, and a second point for a grade of *satisfactory*.

The specifications for these assignments are straightforward: a submission is satisfactory if all responses are correct; an error means that the assignment is not satisfactory. If you submit an assignment on time (earning one point), but have an error, you may resubmit a corrected version as often as you like up until the deadline for final revisions for that module. When a revised submission is satisfactory a second point will be recorded for that assignment.

For written assignments, deadlines are *3:00 pm* the day *before* class.

The total points you can earn in this category is 12.

## In-class assessments

In addition to written preparation, we will have regular in-class assessments. *Up to 10* of these will focus on vocabulary; *up to 8* will focus on features of language or grammar.

In-class assessments will always be announced ahead of time, and we will always do at least one practice version together at least one class before we have a graded in-class assessment.

In-class assessments receive a grade of 0 or 1.  You earn a grade of 1 if all answers are correct.  You may retake these assessments as often as you like up until the deadline for retakes.  You may not retake an assessment that you have missed for an unexcused class absence.

The total points you can earn in this category are 10 for vocabulary assessments and 8 for language assessments.

## CBL lab

Throughout the year, you will participate in a weekly CBL lab.

You will receive two grades for CBL lab work.

  - participation: *up to 9* CBL sections are scheduled to meet at Holy Cross.  You earn one point for each section you attend, for a possible total of 9.
  - small group project: satisfactory completion of projects in 3 steps. Each step can earn 2 points, for a total possible of 6 points.

## Determination of final course grade

For each category except the CBL project, the preceding sections define the *maximum* number of assignments. If the daily course changes, and we have fewer than the maximum number of assignments, you will receive full credit for any dropped assignments. For example, if we have 7 in-class language assessments instead of the maximum of 8, you will receive 2 points for the omitted assignment; that plus your points on the seven completed assignments would be your total for the semester in the category of language assessments.

Your course grade will be recorded from the following table.  In the row for each grade, the numbers in each column represent the minimum number of points required in that category.

| Course grade |  Portfolio (18) | Homework (12) | Vocab. assessments (10) | Language assessments  (8) | CBL participation | CBL project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |--- | --- |

# Policies

## Class attendance

Active participation in class is one of the most effective ways to learn ancient Greek.  My expectations for your class attendance follow the college policies posted at [https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#coursepoliciestext](https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#coursepoliciestext).

If at some point in the semester you are unable to complete the required preparation for a single class, please come anyway: staying away only compounds the difficulty of catching up.  If you let me know that you're not prepared, I will not call on you in class.

If you are experiencing symptoms of a communicable disease, please let me know and do *not* come to class.  If you are are unable to attend class for whatever reason, for a shorter or longer period of time, please get in touch with me so we can work out a plan to get you caught up.

## Masking and testing

It is impossible to foresee how COVID and other viral diseases will develop this semester, and we continue to teach and learn in ways we did not anticipate. We will monitor the spread of communicable diseases and re-evaluate our masking practices periodically throughout the semester.

Because even a "mild" case can have serious consequences for at-risk populations, as the semester begins, medical-grade or better masks are required in class and in drop-in hours until further notice.

Masking is equally uncomfortable for us all, but feeling unsafe creates a poor learning environment so please do your part. Please continue to proactively monitor, test, and isolate at the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with any individuals with known infections. We will continue to closely monitor viral surges and current College recommendations in regards to COVID-19 and any other infectious diseases (e.g., monkeypox) that might emerge as we move through the semester.

## Diversity and Inclusivity

The study of the ancient Mediterranean world belongs to all of us: if you have chosen to study ancient Greek, then you belong here. The diversity that our student body brings to this class is a resource, a strength and a shared benefit for all of us.

In developing this course, our aim has been to make the course materials and our interactions with each other respectful of diversity of all kinds: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.  If you have suggestions about how to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups, please share them.

## Accommodations for disabilities

Any student who feels the need for accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of Disability Services to discuss support services available. The office can be reached by calling 508 793-3693 or by visiting Hogan Campus Center, room 215A.

If you are already registered with Disability Services, please let me know as soon as possible, so that I can take account of this in planning for tests or other course activities.

## Academic integrity

You should be familiar with the College’s policy on Academic Integrity posted at
[https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#academicintegritytext](https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#academicintegritytext)




# Peer tutoring

The Department of Classics and the Classics Department Inclusion Committee offer a peer-based tutoring program for Greek 101 students. The tutors have received training through Academic Services and Learning Resources, and can discuss course with ou, help you understand how to solve problems, and suggest independent learning strategies.

Tutoring workshops run as an appointment-based service of 40-minute sessions, at time arranged between you and the Peer Tutor. To set up an appointment with one of the tutors, please contact your professor.
