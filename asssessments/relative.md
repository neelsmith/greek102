## Forms of the relative pronoun

Each of the following English sentences includes a relative pronoun highighlighted **like this**. Give a coresponding form of the Greek relative pronoun, and identify what gender, case and number you have chosen.

Example:

> Q: The man **who** addresses the jury is Euphiletos.

Since *who* refers to the man, we'll use masculine singular for gender and number; it's the subject of the relative clause, so its case will be nominative.

> A: ὅς  : masculine nominative singular
